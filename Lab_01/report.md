# Lab 01 Reflection

In this lab, I learned how to use Git for version control and manage a repository on GitHub. 
I practiced creating new files, updating existing files, and tracking changes using add and commit commands. 
I also learned how to create branches, switch between them, and merge changes into the main branch. 
This lab helped me understand how Git keeps project history organized and supports parallel development.
